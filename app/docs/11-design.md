# Design

To store designed UI wireframes, we are using [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/).

To get access to Report Portal workspace, please contact our UX Designer [Oleksandra Yurchenko](https://telescope.epam.com/who/Oleksandra_Yurchenko).
Also you can discuss all design-related questions with her.

We already have stable style guide, witch includes colors palette, fonts, common elements and ect.
Strongly required to follow it! Color and font variables you can find in `/src/common/css/` folder.

> It's not allowed to use colors and fonts not defined in style guide!

Due to the fact that application is large, there are lot wireframes and Report Portal permanently developing and changes,
sometimes it's can be very hard to keep all wireframes in Zeplin up-to-date.
So, above reasons cause the fact, that we have two sources of knowledge at single moment:

- Zeplin wireframes
- Existing and running application based on BackboneJS.

So, it's really necessary to be sure that there are no differences between task requirements,
zeplin wireframe and Backbone app version.
If you have some misunderstanding related to design or you see such differences -
it's a strong reason to contact UX Designer and resolve all issues, before implementation process will be started.

> We are open for suggestions, witch are help us to improve Report Portal design.
